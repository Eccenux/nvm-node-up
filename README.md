# nvm-node-up

Welcome to **nvm-node-up** (or **nvm-up** for short)! This script allows you to manage **Node updates over nvm** on Windows. Crucially, it enables copying modules from an installed version to a new one. The provided PowerShell command is `nvm-up`.

Below, you'll find information on how to get started, along with links to more details about *nvm-node-up* (docs).

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Refer to the [Installation Guide](./docs/install.md) for setup instructions.

Basically:
1. Download the script.
2. Make it available in PS.
3. Run `nvm-up` and have a fruitful day ðŸš€

## ðŸ§ª Basic usage

This basic commands is all you need to fully switch to a new Node version (with all your modules).

### Prepare and install new Node
Save a list of current global modules:
```Powershell
# (uses a temp file in current dir)
nvm-up globals-list
```
Install new version, e.g. latest LTS:
```Powershell
nvm install lts
```

### Switch and restore
Swtich to new Node:
```Powershell
# (nvm install should tell you what was installed)
# (version 22.17 is obviously just an example)
nvm use 22.17.0
```
Restore global modules:
```Powershell
# (this will use a file generated with globals-list)
# (a list will be shown, and you will be given a choice of installation type)
nvm-up globals-install
```
That's it. Note that you can switch to other versions and also use the command `nvm-up globals-install`. That way, you can easily install your set of modules to many Node versions.
