# (uses a temp file in current dir)
nvm-up globals-list
# install new version, e.g. latest LTS:
nvm install lts
```
```Powershell
# swtich to new (nvm install should tell you what was installed)
nvm use 22.17.0
```
```Powershell
# Restore global modules
# (this will use a file generated with globals-list)
# (a list will be shown, and you will be given a choice of installation type)
